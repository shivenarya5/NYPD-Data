# NYPD-Data

![Part 2 Final - STAT 451](https://github.com/shivenarya5/NYPD-Data/assets/140025907/77409d9e-179b-4f43-bd2d-3f83dd110740)


My project aims to analyze the NYPD shooting crime dataset to explore how crime intensity has evolved over the years in New York. 
This is a valuable endeavor, as understanding crime trends can inform policy-making and community safety initiatives.


Analysis of the Visualization

Why a Line Graph?

A line graph was chosen to effectively represent the evolution of shooting incidents in New York over a 16-year period. Line graphs are excellent for showcasing trends and changes over time, allowing for easy observation of increases or decreases in incident frequency.

Interpretation and Insights

The graph illustrates a fluctuating trend, with a noticeable peak in 2006 followed by a general decline until 2017.
A significant surge is observed in 2020, which could be correlated with external factors (e.g., socio-economic changes, policy shifts). The continuation of this upward trend into 2021 is particularly noteworthy.
The visualization clearly communicates the dynamic nature of crime incidents in New York City over the years, providing a visual foundation for more in-depth analysis.

Importance of the Question

Understanding the trend of shooting incidents over time is crucial for informing public safety strategies, law enforcement resource allocation, and community engagement initiatives. It also prompts further investigation into the underlying causes of these trends.
